# Time Series Mining Final Project

This project is the final project of 2110430 Time Series Mining and Knowledge Discovery in Semester 2/2020

## Part I: Optimal weight for DTW distance calculation

## Part II: Shape averaging method
The project is about shape averaging method of multiple time series sequences. The method that using in this project called "DTA: Dynamic Time Warping Barycenter Averaging".

The implemented python code ```dba.py``` got from [fpetitjean/DBA](https://github.com/fpetitjean/DBA) based on the papers below
* [Pattern Recognition 2011](http://francois-petitjean.com/Research/Petitjean2011-PR.pdf): A global averaging method for Dynamic Time Warping
* [ICDM 2014](http://francois-petitjean.com/Research/Petitjean2014-ICDM-DTW.pdf): Dynamic Time Warping Averaging of Time Series allows Faster and more Accurate Classification
* [ICDM 2017](http://francois-petitjean.com/Research/ForestierPetitjean2017-ICDM.pdf): Generating synthetic time series to augment sparse datasets
